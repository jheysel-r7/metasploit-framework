## Vulnerable Application

Git in versions <= 2.29.2 includes git-lfs extension which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's Windows system upon a
clone operation.

### Vulnerable Installation

1. Download a vulnerable version of Git for Windows: [v2.28.0](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.28.0.windows.1/Git-2.28.0-64-bit.exe)
2. On the `Select Components` section of the installer, make sure Git LFS is selected (should be by default)
3. You should now be able to run the exploit and get a session on Windows

## Verification Steps

1. Install the application
2. Start msfconsole
3. Do: `use exploit/multi/http/git_lfs_rce`
4. Do: `run`
5. Ensure the exploit sets up a repository to be cloned, ex: `http://192.168.123.1:8080/fixflex.git`
6. From the victim machine, clone the repository created by the exploit.
7. You should get a shell.
